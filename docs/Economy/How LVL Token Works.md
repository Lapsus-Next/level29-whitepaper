# LEVEL (LVL) Token Utility

The LEVEL token (LVL) is the core of our gaming ecosystem, fueling all major gameplay, progression, and reward mechanisms across our games.

## 🎮 In-Game Use Cases

LVL is deeply integrated into the game loop and progression systems. Players earn and spend LVL through gameplay, making it an essential part of the experience.

**How to Earn LVL:**

- Competing in **PvP battles**
- Winning **Clan vs Clan events**
- Completing **weekly and daily tasks**
- Playing in **PvE missions and events**
- Achieving higher **player levels** (higher level = higher earning potential)

**How to Spend LVL:**

- **Upgrade weapons** and kitchen tools
- **Incubate and breed monsters**
- **Unlock and upgrade Clan Science**
- **Participate in Clan-exclusive events**
- Access **rare content**, speedups, and utility items

LVL is not just a currency—it’s a progression mechanic. The more you play and contribute, the more powerful your experience becomes.

## 🏦 Staking & Rewards

A dedicated in-game staking system—**The Bank**—is coming soon.

Players will be able to **stake LVL directly in-game** to receive:

- Up to **15% passive earnings**
- **Exclusive rewards**, including:
  - Legendary monster eggs
  - Rare coins
  - Time speedups
  - Other high-tier in-game boosts

Staking adds a strategic layer to token holding, encouraging long-term engagement over short-term speculation.
