# ðŸŽ® Welcome to Level29 Games

## About Level29 Games

### ðŸŽ¯ Vision

_To build the most player-centric Web3 gaming studio where strategy, fun, and ownership come togetherâ€”without friction, wallets, or Web3 jargon._

### ðŸš€ Mission

_We create games that are actually fun firstâ€”designed to challenge, engage, and grow with the player. By blending intuitive mobile gameplay with invisible Web3 infrastructure, we unlock real ownership and community-driven ecosystems that anyone can join, no crypto knowledge needed._

## ðŸ’¡Our Philosophy: Gameplay First, Web3 Seamlessly Integrated

Most Web3 games have lost the challenge, prioritizing tokens over genuine fun and strategic depth. Level29 Games changes that. We craft **strategy-driven** and **hypercasual mobile experiences** that _feel_ like traditional Web2 games, empowered by invisible Web3 technology. Our focus is on real players, offering challenge, progression, and engagementâ€”without the confusing crypto complexity.

We're a small but mighty team of 7 with 7 years of combined experience in gaming and blockchain, dedicated to making games **anyone** can play and love.

### Our Games

Currently live on **SKALE** and coming soon to **AppLayer**, we build worlds where every click counts.

- **Ramen Rumble:** Our flagship title, a strategic culinary battle launching soon. It's a taste of what Web3 gaming _should_ be: fun, accessible, and built to last.
- **Tuk Tuk Rumble:** A bite-sized arcade racer, already live on the Play Store for instant action.

## ðŸ§© Why Web3?

We embrace Web3 not for the hype, but because it uniquely solves real problems that Web2 simply canâ€™t, all while ensuring a zero-friction experience:

- **True Ownership:** You're a stakeholder. Own your in-game items, trade your rewards, and carry your progress.
- **Open Economies:** We enable player-driven marketplaces and ecosystems, giving you a voice in shaping the game's world.
- **Transparency + Trust:** Blockchain provides verifiable, tamper-proof systems that put players first.
- **Invisible Blockchain:** Weâ€™ve hidden the tech. No wallets, no jargonâ€”just play.

We believe Web3 is the future of gaming, but only if it puts _gameplay first_. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re **Level29**.
