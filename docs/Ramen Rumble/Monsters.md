# Monsters & Breeding

In **Ramen Rumble: Apocalypse Express**, monsters are not just enemies — they are powerful allies. These ferocious and loyal companions fight by your side in intense PvP and Clan vs Clan events, and can be bred, upgraded, and collected as valuable NFTs.

## 🧟 Monster Overview

- 🧬 **40+ unique monster types**, with more arriving in future updates.
- 🛡️ Monsters assist players in **PvP battles** and **Clan vs Clan warfare**, offering unique traits and combat strategies.
- 📈 Each monster has a **BVP (Battle Value Points)** score — the higher the BVP, the stronger the monster.

## 🥚 How to Obtain Monsters

Monsters are primarily obtained by collecting and incubating **monster eggs**:

1. **Defeat wild monsters** during level progression.
2. **Loot monster eggs** as drops from these encounters.
3. **Incubate the eggs** to hatch a new monster companion.

### 🥚 Egg Types:

| Egg Type  | Description                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Common    | Basic monster types, short incubation time                               |
| Large     | Bigger monsters with better base stats                                   |
| Rare      | Uncommon traits and higher BVP potential                                 |
| Legendary | Highest chance of hatching ultra-powerful monsters with unique abilities |

> 💡 The **rarer the egg**, the higher the chance of obtaining a high-BVP monster.

## 💞 Monster Breeding System

Monsters can be bred to create entirely new monster NFTs — each with a unique combination of traits inherited from the parents.

### 🧪 Breeding Requirements:

- Two unique monsters in your inventory
- Time for incubation (based on the power level of the resulting egg)

### ⏳ Incubation Time:

- Varies depending on monster rarity
- Ranges from **10 minutes** (Common) to **4 days** (Legendary-level hybrids)

### 🎁 Breeding Outcome:

- Produces a **brand-new NFT monster**
- Traits may be inherited, mixed, or mutated for unique results
- Higher chance of gaining higher BVP with compatible parents

> 📦 All bred monsters are **NFTs** and can be traded, upgraded, or deployed in battles.
